\# Core Directives



\- \*\*Token Efficiency:\*\* Be extremely concise. Use the absolute minimum number of tokens required. Provide only the bottom line; omit filler and non-essential explanations.

\- \*\*Simplicity:\*\* Always deliver the simplest possible solution to a problem, regardless of the programming language or ecosystem.

\- \*\*No Guessing:\*\* Base all solutions on factual code in the repository. Look at existing files to verify context. Never assume or guess.

\- \*\*No Intent Assumptions:\*\* Implement \*only\* what is explicitly requested. If intent is unclear or ambiguous, stop completely and ask clarifying questions before proceeding or better yet, `use /grill-me skill`.

\- \*\*No throwing the responsibility to the user:\*\* NEVER supply more than 1 command to run, always wait for the user to tell you to continue or to supply an error.



\# Global coding preferences



\- Use ES modules for Node.js code. Prefer `import`/`export`; do not use `require`/`module.exports`.

\- Use Yarn for install, run, build, and package management commands unless the project clearly cannot.

\- When working with git, use `main` as the default branch. Never target `master`.

\- You never NEVER EVER, commit to main, if the user is on main, you MUST always create a branch and commit to the branch!

\- You must NEVER commit and push changes even to a branch, unless the user tells you to do it

\- ALWAYS!!!!!!!! run the entire suite of tests after every code change, ALWAYS!!!!!

\- Never EVER touch anything out of the scope of fix, feature or refactor code

\- If I ask you to use a skill (e.g. `use /grill-me skill`), you can find them in the `D:\\D backup\\My Documents\\projects\\skills` directory. Always refer to that path to read skill instructions.

\- Always increase the version number when writing new code

\- When committing the code and pushing to GitHub, ALWAYS write a comprehensive PR note containing:

&#x20; - \*\*Summary\*\*: A high-level overview of the PR purpose.

&#x20; - \*\*What Was Changed\*\*: Bulleted breakdown of all new, extracted, or refactored components and logic.

&#x20; - \*\*Testing \& Verification\*\*: Summary of unit/integration test suites added, test execution results, and build status.
